Vilhjalmur Stefansson (November 3, 1879 – August 26, 1962), an anthropologist and arctic traveller, After living with the Inuit for 4 years Stefansson was convinced that the Arctic Inuit people’s fat and meat-based diet was a nutritionally complete and healthy diet. To prove this, he and a fellow- his fellow explorer Karsten Anderson took part in a year-long study where they ate only animal fat and meat, without vitamin or mineral supplements. At the end of the year there were no signs of vitamin deficiencies or kidney problems in the subjects; they did not suffer fatigue, they were mentally alert, physically active, and showed no specific physical changes in any system of the body - [Prolonged Meat Diets with a Study of Kidney Function and Ketosis](http://m.jbc.org/content/87/3/651.full.pdf)

Dr. Donaldson went to medical school in the late 1800s and practiced medicine in New York until the mid-1900s. His book was published in 1961. He had very good success treating his obese patients with an all-meat diet. His general prescription was 6 oz of lean and 2 oz of visible fat three times per day from either lamb or beef. He never recommended pork, chicken, fish, or eggs, but only meat from ruminants. He says that if his patients did not eat enough food, enough times a day, they would invariably stop losing body fat.

Walter L. Voegtlin (1904–1975) was an American gastroenterologist and pioneer of the Paleolithic diet. In his ambitious work of theoretical and practical bases, Voegtlin states that an animal meat-fat diet is considered to be the only diet that is a perfect fit for the physiological functioning of people. Voegtlin also states that raw vegetables should be completely excluded, and fermented vegetables can be eaten in moderation, while eating fruits is only acceptable if eaten in small amounts and not regularly.

### Dr H.L.Newbold
#### [The Type A Type B weight Loss Book](https://eatmeatdrinkwater.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/the-type-a-type-b-weight-loss-book-by-h-l-newbold.pdf) (1991) (PDF)
Dr. H. L. Newbold (1921–1994)  was another early advocate for an all-meat diet. He published a number of books throughout his career, but his last one The Type A / Type B Weight Loss Book is by far his best overall book on diet. It represents the culmination of everything he had learned about health and nutrition up to that point in time.
Dr. Newbold worked extensively with people who suffered with obesity and eating disorders. He found that many of his patients were able to lose weight and stop destructive eating behaviour if they ate an all-meat diet comprised almost entirely of beef.
