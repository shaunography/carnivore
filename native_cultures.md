A number of native cultures survived and even thrived on highly carnivorous diets. The Mongols were said you eat copious amounts of meat (up to ten pounds in a sitting), go days in the saddle without food and were much more robust then their contemplative rivals of whom most of them they conquered. The Inuit/Eskimo go months on end without a single plant food, subsisting on sea mammals and fish and the Native Americans ate a plethora of animals ranging from deer and buffalo to squirrel and beaver.
