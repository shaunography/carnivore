Salicylates are another phytochemical used to fight back against predators. There are many drugs developed from the salicylate family including aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). And they are often used in perfumes and as a preservative. 
Symptoms of salicylate intolerance include; fatigue, asthma like symptoms, hives, swelling and Gastro Intestinal issues, acne, headaches, Tinnitus and anxiety. 

Like Oxalates, salicylates can bioaccumulate in the body over time increasing the risk of adverse affects.
Most fruits are high in salicylates. And like oxalates that bioaccumulate, they can be hard to pinpoint that they are the troublemakers.

- Avocado
- Berries
