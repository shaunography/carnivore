Arguably the most beneficial aspect of the carnivore diet is the elimination of problematic plants and their toxins. Due to their stationary nature plants have evolved to be masters of chemical warfare and in the arms races of natural selection have developed numerous natural pesticides to help avoid predation. To quote Bruce N. Ames and his 1990 paper [“Dietary pesticides (99.99% all natural)”](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/87/19/7777.full.pdf).

> We calculate that 99.99% (by weight) of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves. Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests, and about half (27) are rodent carcinogens; these 27 are shown to be present in many common foods.” 

It is also worth considering the complete abundance of various fruits and vegetables we have available today, and at any time of the year. This was not possible even a 100 years ago when our great grandparents relied on a small number of seasonal staples and exotic far-flung fruit were a rare special treat.
