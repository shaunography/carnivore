Polyphenols and flavonoids are plant pigments often called phytochemicals or phytonutrients by those that way inclined. They give fruit their bright attractive colours and for the most part are not a plant defence mechanism but in high doses can cause kidney damage, tumours, thyroid disruption
High dose In vitro (test tube) studies have shown Polyphenols to behave like antioxidants. However, unnaturally high dose human studies don’t show much promise. This is probably because they are poorly absorbed, transformed by our small intestine, liver, and colon, into completely different substances and quickly eliminated from the body

Common Polyphenols include:
- Anthocyanins
- Quercetin
- Resveratrol
- ellagitannins

Foods containing Polyphenols:
- Green Tea
- Coffee
- Berries
- Apples
- Grapes
- Apricots
- Dark Chocolate
