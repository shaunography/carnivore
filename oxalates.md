title: "Oxalate's (Oxalic Acid)"
---
Oxalic Acid is another natural plant pesticide that aims to dissuade insects from eating them by creating sharp crystals that damage the insect’s mouth when chewing. It is also used to bind and store minerals in the seed for later use by the growing seedling.
In humans Oxalic Acid binds to minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium) preventing absorption and can form insoluble crystals (Calcium Oxalate) that get deposited around the body causing tissue damage and inflammation. Oxalates are lethal in high enough doses, are a common cause of kidney stones and are linked to numerous conditions including osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, sleep disturbance, fatigue, joint pain, breast cancer, rashes and vulvodynia.
Certain gut microbiota can digest and break down small amounts of Oxalate before it can bind to minerals and cause any damage, suggesting people who have impair gut function and increased permeability may be at a higher risk of symptoms. Boiling vegetables can also slightly reduce the Oxalate content; however, humans did not evolve with access to high power blenders with which to produce highly concentrated green smoothies and juices.
Switching to a low Oxalate diet can cause Oxalate dumping which can make symptoms worse in the short term. Sauna sessions and citrate (magnesium and potassium citrate) can help break down and remove Oxalate crystals from the body.

Foods high in oxalate include:
- Spinach
- Almonds
- Sweet Potatoes
- Cocoa
- Tea
- Soy
- Cauliflower
- Broccoli
- Beetroot
- Kiwi Fruit
