title: "Phytates (Phytic Acid)"
---
Like Oxalates, Phytic Acid binds to minerals (zinc, iron, copper, magnesium and phosphourous) to create Phytates that prevent their absorption. Phytates store energy and minerals for the sprouting seed. When a seed sprouts, phytase enzymes break down the stored phytates and make use of them to grow.
Refining, soaking, sprouting and fermenting grains can reduce the phytic acid content, but this traditional wisdom has been mostly lost and in my opinion is not worth the time and effort required.
Due to its mineral stealing properties Phytates can cause iron deficiency anemia, fatigue and other mineral deficiencies including zinc which can increase susceptibility to infection and skin issues. 

Foods high in Phytates include:
- Whole Grains
- Nuts
- Legumes
- Beans
